Be welcomed by the large demon on the porch and rest on the built on bench. Freely walk through the very open floor plan, and still feel claustrophobic. No sunlight beaming through the windows. Add a ladder inside and climb up to a small elevated space with a window. Perfect for anxiety and gazing up at the stars.",
